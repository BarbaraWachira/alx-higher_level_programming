0. Read file
mandatory
Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout:

Prototype: def read_file(filename=""):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.

1. Write to a file
mandatory
Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written:

Prototype: def write_file(filename="", text=""):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.
Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist.
Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.

2. Append to a file
mandatory
Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added:

Prototype: def append_write(filename="", text=""):
If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.

3. To JSON string
mandatory
Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string):

Prototype: def to_json_string(my_obj):

4. From JSON string to Object
mandatory
Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string:

Prototype: def from_json_string(my_str):

5. Save Object to a file
mandatory
Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation:

Prototype: def save_to_json_file(my_obj, filename):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the object can’t be serialized.

6. Create object from a JSON file
mandatory
Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”:

Prototype: def load_from_json_file(filename):
You must use the with statement
You don’t need to manage exceptions if the JSON string doesn’t represent an object

7. Load, add, save
mandatory
Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file:

You must use your function save_to_json_file from 5-save_to_json_file.py
You must use your function load_from_json_file from 6-load_from_json_file.py
The list must be saved as a JSON representation in a file named add_item.json
If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created

8. Class to JSON
mandatory
Write a function that returns the dictionary description with simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object:

Prototype: def class_to_json(obj):
obj is an instance of a Class
All attributes of the obj Class are serializable: list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean

9. Student to JSON
mandatory
Write a class Student that defines a student by:

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py)

10. Student to JSON with filter
mandatory
Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 9-student.py)

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attribute names contained in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved

11. Student to disk and reload
mandatory
Write a class Student that defines a student by: (based on 10-student.py)

Public instance attributes:
first_name
last_name
age
Instantiation with first_name, last_name and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
Public method def to_json(self, attrs=None): that retrieves a dictionary representation of a Student instance (same as 8-class_to_json.py):
If attrs is a list of strings, only attributes name contain in this list must be retrieved.
Otherwise, all attributes must be retrieved
Public method def reload_from_json(self, json): that replaces all attributes of the Student instance:
You can assume json will always be a dictionary
A dictionary key will be the public attribute name
A dictionary value will be the value of the public attribute

12. Pascal's Triangle
mandatory
Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything
Whiteboard first
Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of n:

Returns an empty list if n <= 0
You can assume n will be always an integer
